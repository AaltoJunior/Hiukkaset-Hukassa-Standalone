    "A CERN summer intern has been tasked with studying the research data measured by CMS in 2011. The data includes a selection of events where two muons were detected by a particle detector. Based on previous observations, it is known that many particles can decay into just two muons and can be identified by their invariant mass. A busy summer intern has forgotten to keep the important measurement data in order. Now he has six strangely named files of CMS measurement data. Each file contains the measured values of two muons, perhaps from the decay of a particle. A summer intern asks for your help in examining the contents of the files.\n",

    "## Invariant mass?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of particle physics, the formulas of ordinary mechanics may no longer apply when mass is converted into energy and vice versa. But conservation laws do exist! The energy and the amount of motion of particles can be used to form a quantity called **invariant mass**. It is a mathematical value describing the mass characteristic of a decayed parent particle and is \"invariant\" to the measurement environment, i.e. it can be calculated anywhere and for anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantity is useful when dealing with particles that decay in less than a fraction of a second. For example, the Higgs particle has a lifetime expectation of $10^{-22}$ seconds [[6](#higs)], so it can be difficult to weigh even on an analysis scale. A device like the CMS measures the amount of motion and energy of the decaying particles, the daughter particles, and the _invariant mass_ can be calculated from them. The invariant mass of the daughter particles from a given decay is close to the mass of the parent particle. For unrelated particles, on the other hand, the invariant mass describes nothing, but is just background noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The invariant mass is thus conserved as the particle decays into new particles.** Particle detectors such as CMS mainly detect these daughter particles, which are more stable than the parent particles. Since there are huge number of decays in each collision, and calculating the invariant mass of unrelated particles gives nothing but noise, researchers have to look at large amounts of data. The **Histogram** is an excellent tool for examining data, as it makes it easy to separate noise from meaningful results. Spikes in the invariant mass histogram can indicate a particular energetic parent particle.\n",
